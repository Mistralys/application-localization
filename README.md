# Application Localization

PHP and Javascript localization library, written in PHP. This was historically integrated in several applications, and has been moved to a separate package to make maintaining it easier.

It is a simple localization layer that stores translated strings in ini files.

NOTE: The current state still has dependencies in the applications, which will gradually be moved into the package.
