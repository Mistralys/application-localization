## v1.3.0
- Minimum PHP version increased to PHP7.3.
- Currency: `parseNumber()` now always returns a value (and throws an exception if it fails).
- Currency: Added `tryParseNumber()` method, which behaves like `parseNumber()` did previously.
- Javascript parsing: Now using the separate `JTokenizer` package instead of bundling it.
- Solved deprecated warnings and errors in PHP7.4+.
